Company Profile :

Staret Foods is specialized for the elderly based on their dietary needs. Staret Foods mainly serves Singapore. Their main target group is people who are over 60 and have special dietary needs. Even though there are many food delivery services in the market, Staret Foods is the monopoly in the elderâ€™s food business. Since its focus group is the elderly, Staret Foods wants to maintain their website as easily accessible and more secure from vulnerabilities. I have been approached with the above requirement from Staret Foods, and my suggestion is to use ECS with Terraform infrastructure using the Far Gate (serverless) platform. As a cloud infrastructure engineer, I extended my support to make their application more secure and reliable based on the cloud DevSecOps approach in an automated CI/CD pipeline. Technical recommendations are as follows in detail:

Cloud infrastructure dependencies:

AWS ECS with Far gate is a serverless computing platform that makes running containerized services on AWS easier than ever before. With Far gate, a user simply defines the compute resources, such as CPU and memory, that a service will need to run, and Far gate will manage where to run the container behind the scenes. There is no point where setting up an EC2 instance is required. Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool created by Hashicorp to make handling infrastructure more straightforward and manageable.
